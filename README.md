# Stock-Prices-Prediction-using-SVM
Stock prices prediction can be done by using different machine learning algorithms. I have used Support Vector Machine(Linear SVM, Polynomial SVM and RBF SVM). Results of all these 3 SVM models have been shown in the form of graph using Matplotlib.Besides this, Sklearn library has been used.
